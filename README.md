# ctz.digital-front-end-test

A repo to be forked by Front End Dev applicants

The following is a challenge of both front-end functionality and UI/UX. There are no framework/module restrictions, although Clicktripz does work in React with a heavy lean on MUI ;)

1. Fork this repo
2. Create an app (`create-react-app` is totally fine!) view leveraging the sample `data.json` file to do the following:
