## Usage

To give a brief overview of how I have organized everything, I've arranged all of the company's settings along the top. Below that, you will find a list of the company's sites on the left. If you wish to see more details about a site, you can click the button at the right end of each site's row. This will produce a component that displays all of the site's active products with enabled/disabled status along with other details and a slider to adjust the timing of the Script Load Delay Setting.
